# Factions

Exciting technologies have been discovered buried in the moon's crust after an ancient battle between an alien race, and humanoids caused its explosion.&#x20;

These fossilized remains have attracted the attention of intergalactic species competing to exploit them.

They now exist divided into factions:

* Geth'lee
* Pomril
* Zephlor
* Luridae

## The Geth'lee

Geth'lee Communion claims to have been the dominant race in the galaxy, capable of intergalactic travel before their culture succumbed to a "purist" belief structure aimed at eradicating decadence and gluttony.

They added the suffix "Lee" to their names to remind future generations not to revert to their earlier ways.&#x20;

Wealthy Geth technocrats devised a way to transfer their consciousness to black holes to evade the Geth'lee.&#x20;

No communication with the Geth has occurred in millennia, but rumors suggest that secret societies of Geth scientists remain active.&#x20;

Recently, Geth'lee purists have changed their stance toward high technology, focusing more on medical and defensive advancement and less on gunboat-style diplomacy.

## Pomril&#x20;

The Pomril state that the "big bang" was an evolution that had to take place to create a more perfect universe with predictable physics laws.&#x20;

They believe their existence was pre-programmed into the big bang, and this version of the universe belongs to them.&#x20;

An entire religious structure around this set of beliefs has led to this race treating everything they've encountered as inferior.&#x20;

Proof of their claims is spotty and the religious structure refuses to share evidence.

It's interesting to note that the biochemistry of this race shows almost no evidence of evolution, and the few changes to their DNA prove their race to be billions of years old.&#x20;

Unlike the universe, their language and fully developed alphabet have changed little in billions of years.&#x20;

Surviving religious texts predict cosmic events like stars being born a specific color light years away from their home planet.

## Zephlor

Hailing from a dimension beyond spacetime, the Zephlor are a collective consciousness united by the concept of harmony.&#x20;

Unlike individuals like the Geth'lee or Pomril, the Zephlor function as a singular entity.&#x20;

They are drawn to the ancient technology buried in the moon's crust not for personal gain or power, but to incorporate it into their collective for the greater good.&#x20;

Seeking balance and harmony, the Zephlor look to ancient knowledge to bring stability to the galaxy's many entities and their conflicting priorities.

## The Luridae,&#x20;

\


A highly secretive species of shape-shifters known for their ability to mimic other creatures.&#x20;

They are interested in cultural artifacts, stories, and languages which they incorporate into their constantly evolving identity.&#x20;

They travel in massive ark ships from one celestial body to another, scavenging resources and technology.&#x20;

Their ability to adapt foreign technology for their own use has made them experts.&#x20;

The moon's technological remains represent a treasure they cannot ignore.

**The Quantum Realm**&#x20;

This is where the factions live. It is divided into four sectors:&#x20;

\


* The Quantum Realm
* Ethereal Pool
* Zephlor Bridge
* Luridae's Last Stake

\


Each area attracts different blockchain communities with specific resources and environmental factors.&#x20;



Certain items required for crafting or breeding can only be found in these areas, and users must have some Tron in their wallet to buy or rent anything.&#x20;

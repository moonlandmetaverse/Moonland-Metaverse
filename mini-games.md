# Mini Games

The developers have some exciting plans in store for the gameplay experience.&#x20;

They are currently working on adding mini-games to the mix, which will come equipped with a game editor.&#x20;

These mini-games will allow players to earn quest items and unlock new crafting components upon completion.&#x20;

In addition, advertisers will have the opportunity to sponsor tournaments and events, making the experience all the more exciting.&#x20;

Access to these mini-games will be bid on by digital landowners.

The mini-games will be based on classic games, while more complex options like MOBA, turn-based strategy, and digital deck builder are also being developed.&#x20;

With these exciting additions, players will have even more opportunities to immerse themselves in the game world and enjoy all it has to offer.



## MOBA <a href="#docs-internal-guid-953ff1c2-7fff-f2fa-69c1-b660d38ae240" id="docs-internal-guid-953ff1c2-7fff-f2fa-69c1-b660d38ae240"></a>

Lunarchy will be a post-apocalyptic-themed MOBA that transports players to the moon. Players can only enter player-owned land or claimed territory in this exciting game.&#x20;

One of the unique features of Lunarchy is the play-to-earn mechanic, which aims to prevent botting and cut down on griefing in ranked battles.&#x20;

With various game modes and leagues, Lunarchy will satisfy the cravings of even the most discerning PC gamers.&#x20;

Whether you're a seasoned MOBA player or new to the genre, Lunarchy promises to deliver a one-of-a-kind gaming experience that will keep players coming back for more.&#x20;

# Key Features

### Digital Real Estate

In Moonland Metaverse, land is a valuable, purchasable asset that exists as an NFT. Land owners have the liberty to develop their property in any way they see fit, from constructing buildings and setting up businesses to creating games or social hubs. They also earn revenue from activities occurring on their land, such as transactions, events, or advertising.

### NFT Characters and Assets

Moonland Metaverse is populated by a myriad of unique NFT characters, each with their backstory and skill set. Users can collect, trade, or rent these characters for various purposes within the Metaverse. They also have the ability to create, buy, and sell other types of NFT assets, such as vehicles, weapons, or artifacts.

### In-Metaverse Economy

The economy of Moonland Metaverse is powered by our native token, MTK, which is used for transactions, governance, and rewarding users. The value of MTK is intrinsically linked to the activities within the Metaverse - the more vibrant the economy, the more demand for MTK. This setup encourages active participation and investment in the ecosystem, fueling growth and adding value to the entire Metaverse.

# Roadmap at a Glance

Our roadmap outlines the key milestones we plan to achieve as we develop the Moonland Metaverse:

1. **Third Week of July**: Whitelisting begins for the Moonland Metaverse NFT airdrop.
2. **Third Week of August**: Start of the NFT airdrop. 420 NFTs will be airdropped, with each NFT owner eligible to claim 42 MTK tokens in a separate, future airdrop.
3. **ICO and Presale**: Dates to be confirmed, with plans for the presale to occur prior to the main ICO.
4. **Post-ICO**: Following a successful ICO, additional features and enhancements to the Moonland Metaverse will be developed and rolled out as per our project timeline.

Please remember, all these milestones are subject to change depending on regulatory requirements, market conditions, and other factors. We're committed to keeping our community informed of any changes and progress.

# Main Characters

Two figures stand out in the vast expanse of the Moonland Metaverse: Doggo, the charismatic yet deceitful governor, and Sol Boosk, the galaxy's most feared and greedy assassin.

Their alliance was one of convenience and ambition, but it was an alliance that would be tested by the unwavering integrity of a rebel named Kimmi.

Determined to end his reign, she believed that recruiting Sol, with his unparalleled skills, would be the key to her success. With a promise of a substantial reward, she approached the assassin with a plan.

The promise of wealth and the chance to be on the winning side swayed him. Together, they orchestrated a coup that saw Doggo banished into exile.&#x20;

Their plan succeeded, and Kimmi became the new governor of Moonland. She paid Sol the agreed-upon sum for his services, but unfortunately, Sol's greed got the best of him.&#x20;

In a fit of jealousy, he challenged Kimmi to a duel, which he won, and Kimmi was subsequently imprisoned, waiting for someone to rescue her from Sol’s mothership.

As Sol basked in his newfound power and wealth, Doggo saw an opportunity to strike a dark alliance with him and return to Moonland, which saw them both reigning again.&#x20;

The people of Moonland longed for a hero to rise up and lead them to freedom. They hoped that someone would come forward and challenge the new rulers, someone who would be brave, skilled, and determined enough to take down Sal and Doggo's oppressive regime.&#x20;

As they wait for their hero to emerge, the people of Moonland remain hopeful that they’ll be free from tyranny.

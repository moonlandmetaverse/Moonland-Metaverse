# Claimable Territories

Moonland will have an exciting team-play feature where space guilds can compete for lucrative territories.&#x20;

These territories offer economic benefits that will give any guild an edge over their peers. However, claiming these territories won't be easy.

Other guilds must declare war and put down a deposit of game-harvested resources before the battle even starts.

Once a guild secures a territory, they become the proud owners of a valuable asset. They can set a customs rate for visitors who want to access instances or other parts of Moonland that require "moon tourism."&#x20;

Moreover, minigames will spawn in these areas, and to access them, players will have to pay the customs fee along with a portion of their winnings to the territory holder.

### The mechanics

Players can conquer new territories in Moonland. They can gain access to better gear, set tax rates, and govern income generation by holding onto territory.&#x20;

Players must travel to different territories to secure a harbor and gather unique resources. Players must beware of tax at the customs office if entering owned space.&#x20;

Defenders receive 72 hours to prepare for war declaration, limiting attackers based on ship size and destroying failed ships.&#x20;

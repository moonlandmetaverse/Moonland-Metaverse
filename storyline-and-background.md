# Storyline and Background

Once upon a time, in the year 2142, aliens from planet Nibiru invaded Earth, seeking to destroy humanity and obtain the powerful moon crystals - the most potent energy source known in the universe.&#x20;

The aliens succeeded in their mission and destroyed the moon, causing massive destruction on Earth and leaving only a shattered asteroid ring in its place.&#x20;

Humanity was brought to its knees, and few survivors struggled to rebuild their lives while many perished.&#x20;

However, a few brave individuals rose to the challenge. They began rebuilding civilization on the moon, determined to create a new home for humanity.&#x20;

Now it's 2200, and the Moonland Metaverse awaits exploration, where adventurers can choose their faction and play as a human or as another being from another planet and fight for civilization or its doom.

# Pets & Potions

Moonland Potions are a valuable resource, helping players extend their playtime fairly and sustainably.&#x20;

There are several ways to obtain Moonland Potions. They can be crafted using materials found throughout the game world, or they can be obtained as rewards for completing certain quests or challenges. Players can also purchase potions using in-game currency or real-world money.

One of the unique features of Moonland Potions is that they can be combined for more significant effects.&#x20;

### Here are some of the benefits of using Moonland Potions:

\- Extend playtime: With Moonland Potions, players can continue playing for extended periods, allowing them to make more progress in the game.

\- Fair gameplay: By preventing excessive grinding or account sharing, Moonland Potions ensure that all players have an equal opportunity to succeed.

\- Replenish energy: When a player's power runs low, they can use a Moonland Potion to quickly replenish it and keep playing.

\- Crafting opportunities: Moonland Potions can be crafted using materials found throughout the game world, providing players with an additional avenue for progression.

\- Unique combinations: Players can create powerful boosts to help their pets overcome even the toughest challenges by combining different potions.

## Pets

In Moonland, players can own, trade, and collect unique Non-Fungible tokens (NFT) pets that serve as powerful allies to help them progress and succeed in the game.&#x20;

Pets can be obtained through various means, including in-game purchases, trading, and completing missions.&#x20;

Players can grow and evolve their pets by participating in battles and exploring different areas of the game to discover new items and resources to boost their pets' stats.&#x20;

Collecting and trading pets with other players is also possible, making them a valuable commodity in the game.&#x20;

Players should breed pets to level them up, and considering which pets to breed is important to maximize benefits in the game.&#x20;

Pets can help players increase loot drops and avoid danger, making them a valuable asset to any player looking to gain an edge.&#x20;

## The Galactic Puppy Mill

This is where players can purchase pets to progress in the game. Players who hold NFTs with breeding rights will stock the mill, and breeders can provide pets without breeding rights to populate the cosmetics ecosystem.&#x20;

Rare cosmetic traits can be maintained by breeders who can create a monopoly by breeding pets with those traits and selling them to others.

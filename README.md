# Moonland Litepaper Summary

The Moonland Dev team has built all the core aspects of the Moonland Metaverse. Our movement system, flying system, and all base world systems have been fleshed out.&#x20;

This includes player login, zone spawning, character selection, inventory system, and quest system. Alongside the enemy and NPC work, Outside the game itself, we have been able to work out the Game Installer, automatic update system, and initial server infrastructure deployed for early access and alpha testing.

With this first level of detail for Moonland’s technology underway in just over one year, the Moonland Dev team has created the foundation that Moonland will build upon for the years to come.

Moonland is a hybrid metaverse RPG that blends the living economy aspects of an MMO with Web3 technologies.&#x20;

Every aspect of the internal economy will be tokenized, and all economic activity will require interaction with services hosted on player-owned digital real estate.&#x20;

Owners of this real estate will compete with other land owners to draw as many renters and visitors to their estate to sell digital advertising or collect rewards from Web3 transactions.

To stimulate the Moonland Economy, we designed an economic model based on proven successful use cases and adapted them to a web3 platform.

These methods will be detailed later in the litepaper, but the main goal is to create a metaverse experience that allows traditional businesses to invest their marketing budgets in our advertising portal.

Drawing users into the metaverse is a big challenge. Most traditional video games have a lifespan of a few years, while some MMO’s have been able to prosper for 20+ years.&#x20;

By incorporating the best ideas from legacy MMO’s and adding sustainable play-to-earn mechanics, Moonland hopes to achieve a large player base that will allow outside advertisers to achieve a competitive “return on advertising spend.”

Moonland won’t only cater to gamers. It’s meant to be a metaverse that attracts all kinds of interest. Those who wish to watch a streamer, listen to music, go to a concert, or socialize can do so in Moonland.

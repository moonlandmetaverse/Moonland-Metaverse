# Moonland Metaverse LitePaper

Welcome to Moonland, a revolutionary gaming social multiplayer that merges blockchain technology with action-packed RPG gameplay. Moonland is an online RPG that is free to play and features 28 base characters for players to choose from. With a connected wallet, players can fully customize these characters, mint them as NFTs, and trade them with others. Even without connecting a wallet, we keep track of your player level and story progression, ensuring that your progress is always saved.

Blockchain technology and NFTs Moonland utilizes blockchain technology to enable NFT functionality and provide a secure, transparent, and immutable ledger for all transactions within the Metaverse. This means that the ownership of virtual assets is verifiable and can be traded on decentralized marketplaces. The use of NFTs in Moonland enables players to own and trade their virtual assets, unlocking new revenue streams and providing players with more control over their virtual assets.

Multi-game access Moonland acts as a gateway to multiple video games within the Metaverse, giving players access to a wide range of games without having to leave the Metaverse. This allows players to seamlessly switch between games and access their virtual assets across different games. This not only enhances the gaming experience but also provides players with the ability to monetize their virtual assets across multiple games.

Moonland offers players a unique gaming experience with high-quality graphics and gameplay. It utilizes the Unreal Engine 5 to create an immersive narrative environment filled with diverse characters and activities. Through captivating storytelling, Moonland pushes the boundaries of gaming, allowing players to own and control their in-game assets in a vibrant virtual world.

In the first stages of the game, players can unlock all 13 of our social multiplayer mini-games, which are based on some of the classics. This feature allows players to take a break from the main story and enjoy some fun multiplayer games with friends.

In-game economy Moonland features an in-game economy where players can buy, sell, and trade virtual assets using NFTs. The in-game economy will be fueled by an internal currency called MoonCoin, which can be bought and sold for other cryptocurrencies or fiat currency. This allows players to earn real-world value from their virtual assets, providing them with a new source of income.

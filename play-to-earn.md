# Play To Earn

## Moonland’s Play to Earn Mechanics

Even if play-to-earn is not Moonland's primary focus, that audience will still be catered to.

Some play-to-earn games feel more like a chore than a fun activity. At Moonland's Metaverse, gaming should be exciting and rewarding.&#x20;

That’s why there will be a system that requires teamwork and strategy to succeed in the most profitable sections of Moonland.&#x20;

No more dull grinding; here are some of the various ways a player can earn a real-life income playing Moonland:&#x20;

* Join forces with a space guild and claim territory together.&#x20;
* Engage in intense faction warfare campaigns.
* Take a daring risk and steal money from their own guild or other players.
* Become a savvy property owner and host events or minigames that players will pay to access.&#x20;
* Invest in digital real estate.
* Raise and sell digital pets, or pit them against others in thrilling battles and complete challenging quests.

#### Moonland Property Management and Player-Owned Real Estate

In Moonland, owning land is an essential aspect of the game. It serves as a place to store items, recharge energy, and earn rewards.&#x20;

However, players cannot just inhabit any plot of land; they must rent from landowners. As the game grows, landowners must construct larger buildings, including skyscrapers.&#x20;

Shops and events are only accessible on player-owned land, and the owner can charge rent to others.&#x20;

Owning an NFT for a plot of land grants access to a Web 2.0 portal that allows the owner to set rent prices and renovate the property.&#x20;

Landowners can also gather information on foot traffic to their property, leading to ad revenue.&#x20;

### The specifics

\- Land ownership in Moonland is similar to scholarship programs in other play-to-earn games.&#x20;

\- Players must upgrade their living arrangements to progress in the metaverse.&#x20;

\- New sections of land can only be occupied through Moonland development proposals, which require a cost.&#x20;

\- If land becomes too valuable for ordinary players, the Moonland Decentral Bank will offer a development proposal to find a buyer to take on a new property.&#x20;

\- Landowners can compete by converting unused space into services that may attract new renters.

## Business Mechanics

#### Digital Real Estate Management and Advertising

Moonland plans to build a dashboard for advertisers and allow digital real estate owners to operate micro-businesses through their own portal.

If someone owns land in the metaverse, they can build venues, attract an audience, and advertisers, allowing players to share in advertising revenue that social media platforms monopolize.

The same applies to players who claim territory. If they attract a streamer or influencer to hold an event on their moon chunk, they can charge a customs fee for visitors and share the profit with their space guild and the entertainer.\


**Web3 Bounty Portal**

Users can earn compensation by completing web3 bounties or "quests" on various websites. Moonland promotes blockchain projects and provides bounties to draw users into the experience, with low costs of acquiring new players thanks to other projects marketing the Moonland brand.

**Music Artist Portal**

In Moonland, digital landowners can use the artist portal to host concerts or play copyright-protected music on their property.&#x20;

Emerging artists can also contribute custom soundtracks during faction warfare campaigns and earn a share of the revenue.

Landowners can negotiate and track payments through their NFT title deed advertising portal.\


**NFT Market place and DEFI opportunities**

Web3 wallets provide access to NFT marketplaces for artwork and items usable in the metaverse.&#x20;

These marketplaces function as player-owned shops, with digital real estate available for rent or commission.&#x20;

The finite limit on Moonland's digital real estate prevents spamming of AI-generated NFT artwork common in traditional marketplaces.&#x20;

Additionally, player-owned digital real estate can host DeFi liquidity pools.&#x20;

Landowners can act as currency exchanges and charge rates for private liquidity pools to prevent a "winner take all" scenario due to slippage.\


**Moonland’s own Twitch**

The amazing tech of Unreal Engine 5 will allow streamers to cross-stream not only to Twitch, YouTube, and Mixer but also to Moonland, where a special area is reserved just for them.&#x20;

This will help with audience engagement, bring more people to Moonland, and create an electrifying environment.&#x20;

There will be a subscriber model for Moonland streamers, allowing them to play exclusive minigames during their streams.

### Decentral Bank

Multiple play-to-earn games are available, where NFT holders can create teams of "scholars" to earn a share of the profits.&#x20;

But Moonland Decentral Bank is here to revolutionize the game. By pooling assets in a decentralized way, users can purchase NFTs from other games and rent them out to players willing to grind for profit.&#x20;

The best part? Players can convert those tokens to MTK, the official currency of Moonland.

But this isn't just about earning profits. The Moonland Decentral Bank has another important mission: to balance the internal economy.&#x20;

Setting tax rates on various activities in the metaverse can prevent cheating or unfair practices. And the taxes generated will benefit all players - they'll be used to fund even more play-to-earn mechanics.

Plus, MTK holders will earn a yield based on the market activity and the central bank's earnings.&#x20;
